title: Validating timezones in Ruby on Rails
date: 13/04/2011

Rails makes it too simple to allow users to specify their timezone. All you have to do is add the following to your form:

	#_form.html.erb
	..
	<%= f.time_zone_select :time_zone, ActiveSupport::TimeZone.us_zones %>
	..
	
	#user.rb
	..
	field :time_zone, :type => String
	..

Now you can see a very nice select element with all the timezones the world has to offer. In the above example, the US
timezones will show before the rest of the world. But what do you do to validate the timezones? You just got to drop
the below in to your model.

	#user.rb
	..
	validates_inclusion_of :time_zone, :in => ActiveSupport::TimeZone.zones_map { |m| m.name }, :message => "is not a valid Time Zone"
	..

Simple!!
