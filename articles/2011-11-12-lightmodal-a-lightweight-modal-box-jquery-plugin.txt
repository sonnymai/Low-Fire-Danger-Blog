## YALB? (Yet Another Light Box?)

It was really hard to find a modal/lightbox that could let you put an instance of tinyMCE inside, so we built this one.

I built it to use on one of our products [LessPlan](http://lessplan.com), a web application to help teachers generate and share lesson plans.

## Features

- Custom callbacks for onShow and onHide
- Click overlay to hide
- Disablable close button

## How

Typical modal/lightbox plugins clone markup and reinsert it into the plugin's own container. This works fine until you have javascript bound to elements or iframes. lightModal, takes a different approach by making the original content container the lightbox, thus keeping any javascript bindings.

##Basic usage

This is the most basic example
