Setting up a proxy for apt-get on Ubuntu

I had installed ubuntu server 10.04 at work behind a proxy. I wanted to do a "aptitude update", which of course won't work till you set up the proxy correctly.

This problem bugged me for a couple of hours, probably because I'm too lazy to RTFM, anyways, after some googling around, I managed to find the solution.

	>sudo vi /etc/apt/apt.conf
	#(apt.conf might not exist in some cases, you should edit "/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/05aptitude" instead)


add this line:

	Acquire::http::Proxy "http://<your proxy server>:<proxy port>/";

Now you should be able to do all your apt-gets and what not. =)

p.s. this also works with autoconfiguration proxy's.
